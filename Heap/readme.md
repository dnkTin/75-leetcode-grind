implement priority queues
where the smallest (or largest) element is always at the root of the tree.

Types of Heaps
There are two main types of heaps:

Max Heap: The root node contains the maximum value, and the values decrease as you move down the tree.
Min Heap: The root node contains the minimum value, and the values increase as you move down the tree.
Heap Operations
Common heap operations are:

**Insert**: Adds a new element to the heap while maintaining the heap property.
**Extract Max/Min:** Removes the maximum or minimum element from the heap and returns it.
**Heapify:** Converts an arbitrary binary tree into a heap.
